a day in their life	 
they're within the normal range	 
didn't research a thing about	 
some they lose some they	 
do you want to be

some they win some they	 
a good thing for me	 
out a day in their	 
all these ideas of this	 
be drops in terms of	 
the top 1% of female	 
don't know whether or not	 
of the time they're not	 
they win some they lose	 
you're going to be every	 
punch somebody in the face	 
lot of the time they're	 
going to realize there's not	 
going to be every single	 
going to be able to	 
we don't know whether or	 
that there's going to be	 
a lot of the time	 
know how she's gonna be	 
that's a good thing for	 
ton of them who have	 
person whether or not she's	 
made all these ideas of	 
and so when you try	 
you need to do is	 
you didn't research a thing	 
to realize there's not as	 
went to disney world and	 
and all that good stuff	 
gonna bother you the fact	 
lose some they win some	 
top 1% of female athletes	 
a ton of them who	 
punched him in the face	 
whether or not she's a	 
win some they lose some	 
these ideas of this person	 
don't know how she's gonna	 
realize there's not as much	 
they lose some they winwe do not know	
is going to be	
do you want to	
as it currently stands	
him in the face	
to be able to	
and as it currently	
you want to go	
a ton of them	
a lot of the	
they lose some they	
going to be a	 
you were able to	 
to realize there's not	 
day in their life	 
that's probably why they	 
is not nearly as	 
good thing for me	 
just talk to them	 
the very minute that	 
like a lot of	 
it's not going to	 
top 1% of female	 
they have a larger	 
need to do is	 
we don't know whether	 
you know she has	 
research a thing about	 
out a day in	 
we know that men	 
the fact that she	 
to be every single	 
i do think that	 
or not she's a	 
didn't research a thing	 
have a ton of	 
going to be every	 
you're going to be	 
drops in terms of	 
this for so long	 
you need to do	 
they're within the normal	 
just going to be	 
be drops in terms	 
men and women and	 
gonna bother you the	 
somebody in the face	 
don't know how she's	 
lose some they win	 
that we have to	 
bother you the fact	 
high school boys who	 
these ideas of this	 
went to disney world	 
within the normal range	 
some they lose some	 
there's not as much	 
going to be like	 
take it from them	 
some they win some	 
of the time they're	 
you want to be	 
lot of the time	 
all that good stuff	 
of them who have	 
the top 1% of	 
know how she's gonna	 
and then you know	 
day after day after	 
we have to recognize	 
want to go further	 
and all that good	 
idea of this person	 
there's going to be	 
you the fact that	 
we have to understand	 
maybe they're not as	 
all these ideas of	 
don't have trans athletes	 
whether or not she's	 
the average man is	 
a day in their	 
there's a lot of	 
know whether or not	 
going to work out	 
ton of them who	 
we just don't know	 
and so when you	 
cannot run as fast	 
talk to them and	 
that type of stuff	 
going to realize there's	 
1% of female athletes	 
the time they're not	 
made all these ideas	 
they have this better	 
on a consistent basis	 
a good thing for	 
ideas of this person	 
person whether or not	 
to disney world and	 
in my personal opinion	 
they're going to be	 
a man could ever	 
so when you try	 
we're just gonna have	 
that's a good thing	 
realize there's not as	 
you know they have	 
punch somebody in the	 
win some they lose	 
they could be in	 
punched him in the	 
you didn't research a	 
that we do not	 
you know being a	 
oh i like you	 
going to be able	 
that there's going to	 
it's supposed to be	 
or at the very	 
how she's gonna be	 
they win some they	 
don't know whether or
